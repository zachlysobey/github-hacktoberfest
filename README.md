# Github Hacktoberfest Counter

Based on [zachlysobey/github-hacktoberfest](https://github.com/zachlysobey/github-hacktoberfest)

## Project Description
This project will eventually let the end user type in a GitHub username and find out if s/he is eligible to win a free T-shirt from Digital Ocean, courtesy of their "Hacktoberfest" promotion.

### Current Status
The script currently works to count all PullRequestEvents made by a user (only those with the `action` of `opened`).
